Gameplay:

This game is a version of the Top Trumps card game against a computer.
Pokemon "cards" are randomly generated from an API with different Pokemons. 
When prompted, the user should select a Pokemon enter a stat which they think is higher than their opponent's (i.e. the computer)
If the player's chosen stat is lower than their opponent's, the player loses their card and it gets put at the bottom of the opponents deck. The opponent then gets to pick the next trump stat.
If the player's chosen stat is higher than their opponent's, they win the round and their opponent's card. Both cards then go to the bottom of the deck and the player get's to pick the next trump.
The game ends when one of the players obtains all 30 cards in the deck.
